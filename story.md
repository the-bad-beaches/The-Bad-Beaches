# Story: The Bad Beaches

## Prologue: Luma Town
Once upon a time, the islands knew only the dark times. A time of endless shadow and conflict, when constant wars were fought for the right to survive. *\[Show a dark scenery\]*

Then, the ancestors built the Light Tower. Its light banished the shadows, ending wars and bringing a new, lasting peace. *\[Show a light scenery\]*

It transformed the land and gave birth to the Luminosity – a form of energy that gives things life. It became their food, their power, and their home: Luma Town. *\[Show grass and glowing mushrooms and lizards\]*

But now, far beneath the surface of Luma town, in the depths of the trenches, a new power has begun to stir… *\[Quick glance at the final boss – the flower (optional)\]*

## Act 1: The Shoreline

### Level 1: (Scripted Tutorial) First Contact
#### Before:
- **Elder**: Guardian! A perfect day for the Light-harvest. Hmm… that’s odd, what’s that crab doing there?
-	**Crab**: *Moves towards the light shrooms and starts attacking.*
- **Elder**: It’s destroying the Luma shrooms! Quick, call the rangers to stop it!
#### During (scripted tutorial):
- Show how to place a ranged unit to kill the crab
  - Make it kill 1 enemy
- Explain resource system and introduce the generator
  - Place generator, place another ranger, kill 2-3 enemies
- Explain unit classes and introduce tanks
  - Place tank, kill 5-6 enemies
#### After:
- **Elder**: That was strange, the crabs don’t usually act violently. The rangers say they were furious for some reason. Keep your guard up.
- **Guardian**: Strange… but at least its handled for now.


### Level 2: The Light Grove
#### Before:
- **Civilian**: Guardian! The light-groves are under attack; the tenders are requesting your assistance!
- **Elder**: What!? Guardian, get your team to the groves right away, you must stop them at all costs.
#### After:
- **Ranger 1**: Elder, you need to see this… They did not just attack to cause small problems; they were shredding our light shrooms.
- **Elder**: \**a few moments of silence*\* (whispering) What is even going on here…
- **Ranger 2**: Reporting now, they did not go for the homes or the food storage huts, they went straight for the grove and ignored everything else.
- **Elder**: What are you trying to say?
-	**Ranger 2**: Their goal was our light grove: it seems like they aim to completely deprive us of the light.
-	**Luma tender**: But… why? It’s the light that’s brought them the peace as well. Why do they hate it so?
- **Elder**: I don’t know but we need to find out. This was not a minor rebellion or accident; it was a deliberate strategic assault of our resources. Guardian, we must call for a meeting… for the first time in generations, we must prepare for war.

### Level 3: (Introduce wave mechanic) The Tower Wall
#### Before:
-	\**Loud alarms ringing*\*
-	**Lookout**: Elder! Guardian! The tide! It’s… it’s not just a wave; it’s a wall of water! It’s coming from the shore!
-	**Elder**: A flash flood? But… the sky is clear! How? Even more unknown dangers are coming our way…
-	**Guardian**: This is not a natural tide; it is moving too fast. The tower wall is about to be flooded.
-	**Luma tender**: The water is so cold… my feet feel like they are freezing in place.
-	**Ranger**: Our enemy, however, seems to be enjoying the water very much. Just look at them swim towards us; they’re moving so fast!
-	**Elder**: They’re bringing the ocean to us! This is their new assault strategy! Guardian, hold the wall for Luma town!
#### After:
-	**Elder**: We held them off. But… something about this doesn’t feel right. The water just receded as fast as it came.
-	**Ranger**: The water is a big problem. My feet got stuck in the mud, I felt so slow.
-	**Luma tender**: I… I was freezing. I couldn’t move at all, and the light was losing its power. The water is their element after all.
-	**Elder**: So, this is their new strategy. They won’t just attack, they can change the battlefield itself. \**After some thought*\* Guardian! This changes everything, we can’t just sit here and wait. What if the flood didn’t recede?
-	**Guardian**: The current; it was flowing from the east, from the Archipelago.
-	**Elder**: Was this one of our neighbours’ attacks, then? We must find out.
-	**Guardian**: But… how?
-	**Elder**: Meet me at the old shipyards. We still have some blueprints from the old days left but we will have to build one ourselves to figure this out.

### Level 4: (Finale for act 1) The Shipyards
#### Before:
-	**Elder**: Guardian! You’re here! Come, come the schematics were indeed useful our engineers are working hard at building the ship we need.
-	**Engineer**: Venerated elder, it is a good plan, but these schematics are ancient and incomplete. We can make up for the missing parts but I’m afraid it will still take some more time.
-	\**Alarms ringing all over*\*
-	**Lookout**: Elder! Guardian! The enemy is attacking! It’s the biggest wave so far and its headed straight for the shipyard!
-	**Guardian**: They know. They must’ve caught wind of our plans and are trying to pin us down right here.
-	**Elder**: This is it then. Guardian, this is our last stand! Command your troops and defend the line. You must buy time for the builders to finish the ship.
#### After:
-	**Engineer**: It’s done! The hull is sealed! She is finally ready to set sail!
-	**Elder**: You did it! Guardian, you’ve… you’ve bought us our future.
-	**Guardian**: Unfortunately, it will have to be a short-lived celebration. The other islands might still be in danger, or they might be the danger. We must find out to be sure.
-	**Elder**: \**Nods and points towards a squad of soldiers*\* Your journey begins now. We cannot spare many, for we still need to defend our homes, but we give you our keenest rangers, strongest defenders and most knowledgeable luma tenders. They are your crew, command them well and may your journey be a successful one.
-	**Ranger**: (*Loudly*) We are at your command, Guardian. Let us find out the true cause behind this disturbance and return peace to our town!
-	**Elder**: Go. And may the Great Light of the Tower guide your path.

## Act 2: The Archipelago

### Level 5: (Introduce Albatross Skystrike) The Nests
#### Before:
- **Ranger 1**: Guardian... the currents brought us here, just as you said. Look at those islands, those cliffs seem to be reaching the skies!
- **Ranger 2**: And look at those huge birds flying around!
- **Shell Knight**: Albatrosses. They command the winds. If a flock that size were to... *strike* the water all at once...
- **Guardian**: It could create a displacement wave, like the one that flooded Luma Town.
- **Ranger 1**: We need to stop them before they do that again!
- **Guardian**: Wait! Look up there... *\*Pointing to a large nest on a cliff\** What is that? It looks like a plant...
- **Luma tender**: That's a gooseneck stalker *(new enemy)*! They are very persistent. Their nests are under attack as well?
- **Guardian**: It looks like it. Let's defend the nests for now and see what's going on with the birds.
#### After:
- **Ranger 2**: We did it! The nests must be safer now.
- **Shell Knight**: Stay alert. We are not yet sure why the gooseneck stalkers are attacking the albatrosses.
- *Albatross leader flies down to the group*
- **Albatross Leader**: Guardian, thank you for saving our nests. You used our 'skystrike' with such precision against the enemies. We are in your debt.
- **Guardian**: We thought you might be behind the floods. Do you know anything about it?
- **Albatross Leader**: US!? No, we have no interest in playing with the waters. Our home is in the skies. The source of this disturbance eludes us as well.
- **Guardian**: That matches what we saw in Luma town. We need to invesigate further.
- **Alabatross leader**: Very well. We see far from the skies, but... even we cannot see far enough to the source of this evil.
- **Guardian**: Then we must continue. Thank you for your help.
- **Albatross Leader**: Wait!! I meant we cannot see that far because our lookout has been overrun.
- **Shell Knight**: An overrun lookout? By what?
- **Albatross Leader**: By those creatures you fought back at the nests. They have taken over our highest cliffs. We had been fighting a losing battle against them. But you've shown great skill in commanding your troops. Will you help us reclaim our lookout?
- **Guardian**: Of course. Lead the way.

### Level 6: The High-Wind
#### Before:
- **Albatross Leader**: This is it. The path to the highest cliff. This is the only location from where we can see far enough but it is heavily overrun.
- **Guardian**: We will clear the way. Stay behind us.
- **Ranger**: They have fortified their position well. We will have to be careful.
- **Shell Knight**: Indeed, we might be walking into a trap.
- **Albatross Leader**: We have no choice. We cannot handle this on our own. But together, we might stand a chance.
- **Guardian**: Alright then. Let's get to it.
#### After:
- **Albatross Leader**: Thank you, Guardian! We are indebted to you for reclaiming our lookout.
- **Guardian**: It was mutual aid. If we are to find the source of this disturbance, we must work together.
- **Albatross Leader**: With this lookout back, we can finally see beyond our usual range.
- **Guardian**: What do you see?
- **Albatross Leader**: There is a large dark mass in the distance, it seems to be *steaming*. It is where the currents are coming from.
- **Shell Knight**: A dark mass... could it be the source of the disturbances?
- **Guardian**: It must be. We need to head there next.
- **Albatross Leader**: Be careful, Guardian. We will send some of our best flyers to assist you on your journey.
- **Guardian**: Thank you. Let's move out.

### Level 7: (Introduce Komodo Ravagers: bosskiller ally) The Volcanic Shores
#### Before:
- **Skystrike Lookout**: Guardian! The dark mass is getting closer. It looks like a volcanic island.
- **Ranger**: Volcanic islands are dangerous. The heat alone can be deadly.
- **Shell Knight**: We are not just dealing with heat. Look at those creatures moving along the shore!
- **Guardian**: Looks like we are not the first ones to arrive here. Let's proceed with caution.
- **Ranger**: What are those lizards doing?
- **Luma tender**: They are Komodos. They are very strong but they seem to be struggling with something.
- **Guardian**: Skystrike team, do you see anything unusual?
- **Skystrike Lookout**: Yes, Guardian. *(after a moment)* The Komodos seem to be under attack.
- **Luma tender**: By what? Komodos are some of the strongest creatures around.
- **Lookout**: They are being overrun by those small pointy creatures. They look weak but there are so many of them!
- **Guardian**: Lets help them out. If we can gain their trust, they might assist us in our mission.
#### After:
- **Komodo Elder**: Guardian, your help was timely. We were on the brink of being overwhelmed.
- **Guardian**: We couldn't just stand by and watch. But why were you being attacked?
- **Komodo Elder**: Those creatures are called Spikers. They have been multiplying rapidly and taking over our territory. We have been trying to fend them off but they are relentless.
- **Shell Knight**: They seem to be part of this larger disturbance from the sea.
- **Guardian**: We need to find the source of this. We thought this volcanic island might be it.
- **Komodo Elder**: We have been here for generations, we have never seen anything like this before.
- **Guardian**: Then we must investigate further. Your strength is welcome on our journey.
- **Komodo Elder**: Thank you, Guardian. In that case, we will send our best warriors to accompany you.

### Level 8: (Boss level + boat map intro where waves stun instead) The Open Ocean
#### Before:
- **Ranger**: I don't like this. We're just sailing east. The Komodo Elder said their volcano was not the source but now we're just moving without direction.
- **Shell Knight**: Patience, Ranger. The lookouts should be able to scout ahead.
- **Guardian**: We have to trust the currents and stay sharp. The source of this disturbance must be discovered.
- *(some shaking in the scene)*
- **Ranger**: What was that? We are stuck on something?
- **Komodo**: By the... It's a primal shark! An ancient, its hide is meant to be like a fortress.
- *(The shark moves its tail and creates a wave, similar to wave everyone had seen previously)*
- **Guardian**: Get ready, everyone! It's a hunter and we are its prey! We need to take it down before it destroys the ship!
#### After:
- **Guardian**: Report! Is everyone... alive?
- **Shell Knight**: We are, but barely. That wave is a critical threat for this boat.
- **Ranger**: That shark was huge, thankfully the Komodos managed to take it down.
- **Komodo**: It was a fierce battle, but we have also never seen a shark like that before. It was too strong.
- **Luma tender**: That was no ordinary shark. It was a primal, an ancient creature that should not be here.
- **Guardian**: What do you mean?
- **Luma tender**: The old scrolls mention that primals are strong creatures that were active during the dark times. They were said to be tamed by the Light and bound to the abyssal trench.
- **Shell Knight**: The abyssal trench? I thought that was supposed to be a myth.
- **Luma tender**: So did I, but that was a primal exactly like the ones described in the scrolls. And if primals are real, so must be the abyssal trench.
- **Guardian**: Then we need to visit this trench. Do the scrolls say where it is located?
- **Luma tender**: Yes, it is said to be located beneath the Holy Land where the Luminous Life was first born, below the *Holy Land of Light*.
- **Guardian**: The holy city? That is indeed a powerful place, lets set our course. We need to get there and find the source of this chaos.

### Level 9: (Introduce Dart Shaman - frog) The Whisper Path
#### Before:
- **Ranger**: Guardian, the lookouts are back. We are still days away from the Holy Land.
- **Luma tender**: Oh dear... Guardian... our food supplies are running low. Our backup Luma shrooms are also depleting fast. We... we didn't plan for a journey this long.
- **Shell Knight**: We cannot arrive at the Holy Land in this state. We cannot fight on an empty stomach either.
- **Guardian**: We need to restock soon. Lookouts, can you scout for any suitable nearby islands?
- **Lookout**: Yes, Guardian. There is an island not too far from here. It seems to be uninhabited but still full of life.
- **Guardian**: Then that's where we are headed. Let's hope we can find enough food there.
- (*On land*)
- **Ranger**: This place looks promising. There are plenty of Luma shrooms here.
- **Luma tender**: Yes, but be careful. The place seems... different.
- **Shell Knight**: Different how?
- *Sudden attack*
#### During:
- *A super fast enemy (maybe a swordfish or a sailfish) shows up during a wave*
- *A frog should show up when fighting to slow it down*
#### After:
- **Ranger**: That was close! Who was it that helped us?
- **Dart Shaman**: I am a Dart Shaman. I sensed your need for help and came to assist you.
- **Guardian**: Thank you, Dart Shaman. Your timing was impeccable.
- **Dart Shaman**: *(nods)* What brings you to this land, outsiders?
- **Guardian**: We are on a mission to find the source of a great disturbance affecting our lands. We believe it is connected to the abyssal trench beneath the Holy Land of Light.
- **Dart Shaman**: But this is not the holy land. Why would you come here?
- **Guardian**: We needed to restock our supplies. Our journey has been long and arduous.
- **Dart Shaman**: I see, but you outsiders make a lot of noise, you have disturbed the *frenzied ones*.
- **Ranger**: The frenzied ones? You mean those fast creatures that attacked us?
- **Dart Shaman**: Yes, they are creatures driven mad by the disturbance. They attack anything that moves. While you fight frenzy with more frenzy, we calm them and slow them down.
- **Guardian**: Your skills are impressive. We could use your help on our journey.
- **Dart Shaman**: I cannot join you on a journey, but I could show you to our village. It is dangerous gathering resources here but the hidden village has plenty to share.
- **Guardian**: We would be eternally grateful. Kindly lead the way.

### Level 10: The Misty Bog
#### Before:
- **Dart Shaman**: This is our village. We live in harmony with the land here, away from the frenzied ones.
- **Frog Elder**: So... you have brought the loud-walkers brother. As I sensed you would...
- **Dart Shaman**: Elder, they fight the 'frenzy' itself. And they are in need of food.
- **Frog Elder**: Hmmm, very well. The frenzied ones follow the *loud*. We will share what we have, but - *(a loud shriek)* - it is... as I feared.
- **Ranger**: No! They're here! But... how? Did we just... lead them here?
- **Frog Elder**: You FOOLS! You have brought the frenzied ones to our homes! This is your doing... you WILL fix this. Our shamans will guide you.
- **Guardian**: You are right, this is our fault. We will make it right.
#### After:
- **Frog Elder**: The frenzy is calmed... it is quiet again. You might be *loud* but you fight with honor, Guardian. Your mistake was fixed, and the village is safe once more.
- **Guardian**: We apologize for bringing the frenzied ones here. It was not our intention.
- **Frog Elder**: It was... inevitable. The frenzy spreads without mercy. No one stays hidden forever.
- **Dart Shaman**: It is dealt with now. Here, take these supplies. They should help you on your journey to the Holy Land.
- **Guardian**: Thank you, Dart Shaman. Your help has been invaluable.
- **Frog Elder**: Go now, Guardian. The Holy Land awaits, and with it, the answers you seek. Our shamans will aid you in calming the frenzy should you encounter it again.
- **Dart Shaman**: WHAT! But Elder, who will guard the village with the shamans gone?
- **Frog Elder**: The village has stood for generations. It will endure. Now go, time is of the essence.
- **Guardian**: We will. Thank you both, and farewell.

### Level 11: Unknown Shores
#### Before:
- **Luma tender**: Guardian, this is it. We should be arriving at the Holy Land soon. Perhaps our lookouts can already see the grand towers of Light already!
- **Ranger**: I don't see anything yet, tender. Lookouts, what do you see from up there?
- **Lookout**: Reporting... I see land ahead, but... there is nothing there at all. It looks completely desolate. No signs of life, or structures.
- **Luma tender**: It can't be... The scrolls spoke of a grand city here, full of light and life. The directions were clear.
- **Shell Knight**: A dead end... after all this. What do we do now, Guardian?
- **Guardian**: We're all tired and shaken. Let's go ashore and rest for now. We can figure out where we are and our next path once we regain our strength.
- *On land*
- **Ranger**: Boots on the ground. Okay, let's set up a camp here for now.
- *A loud shriek followed by an ocean wave hits the shore*
- **Guardian**: Everyone, brace yourselves! Another wave!
#### After:
- **Ranger**: How did they know exactly when to hit us with that wave?
- **Shell Knight**: They weren't following us, they must have been hunting something else and we just happened to be in the way.
- **Luma tender**: But what could be out here in this desolate place?
- **Guardian**: Everyone stay alert! I see movement among the trees.
- *Light priest appears*
- **Stranger**: More... 'frenzied ones'? No... you are not them, you fight them.
- **Guardian**: We mean no harm. We are looking for the Holy Land of Light, we believe it is connected to the disturbances affecting our home.
- **Stranger**: Please... who... in the name of the lost light... are you?

### Level 12: The Ruined Land of Light
#### Before:
- **Stranger**: Please... who... in the name of the lost light... are you?
- **Guardian**: I am the Guardian of the Luma Town. Our lands have been disturbed recently by strange floods and attacks. We believe the source is connected to the Holy Land of Light. While seeking the Holy Land, we arrived here.
- **Stranger**: Holy Land of Light... this place was once that. But now... it is nothing but a graveyard.
- **Luma tender**: No... the grand towers, the huge city... this cannot be.
- **Light Priest**: It *is*. As the city of light, we became too arrogant. We believed that the light was invincible and that it would protect us forever. But once we were attacked, we had no defense. The ocean consumed the city, and only a handful of us light priests survived.
- **Shell Knight**: They... they're just like us... but worse.
- **Guardian**: We need to find out what caused this. It might help us understand the disturbances back home.
- *Loud shriek again*
- **Light Priest**: (panic attack dialog) No! Not again! They... they never stop! They're hunting us!
- **Guardian**: Everyone, brace yourselves! Another wave is coming!
#### After:
- **Guardian**: That's the last of them for now. Are you all alright?
- **Light Priest**: Yes... but you... you fight. You... you won. We prayed for salvation but you brought it instead.
- **Guardian**: Our story is much the same. We are from Luma Town, it too was attacked by the frenzied ones. We managed to fend them off but they kept coming, so we decided to find the source of this disturbance.
- **Light Priest**: Luma Town... I have heard of it. It was said to be a minor shrine. With its own light tower.
- **Luma tender**: Yes, it is our home. The creatures attacking us there were similar to these frenzied ones. They went straight after the light as well. They destroyed some of our shrooms but the light from the tower protected worse harm.
- **Light Priest**: The light tower... it still stands!?
- **Guardian**: It did when we left...
- **Light Priest**: Then there is still hope! *Signals other priests* There is still a beacon of light. Oh Great Light... there is still a beacon...

### Level 13: (Act 2 Finale, boss fight on boat but make it super easy) The Beacon of Light
#### Before:
- **Light Priest**: Guardian! Your tower... it still shines! We... we can feel it! We can... connect to it!
- **Guardian**: Connect? What do you mean?
- **Light Priest**: The light from your tower... it resonates with our own. We will pray not to our shattered shrines, but to your living light!
- *Some humming sounds for prayer maybe?*
- **Ranger**: Whoa... I... I feel so energized! My bow-arm feels steadier than ever!
- **Shell Knight**: My shield feels so much harder... As if the light itself is reinforcing it!
- *Other allies mutter similar lines*
- **Light Priest**: It is done... Guardian! Your light has answered our prayers! We know what you face!
- **Guardian**: What is it? Tell us!
- **Light Priest**: There is only one thing that can fight the light itself. An ancient... primal... 'song' of the Abyssal Bloom. It... it can only grow in the deepest, darkest parts of the abyssal trench.
- **Guardian**: Then it is real... We must go there and stop it.
- **Light Priest**: Yes but... your boat cannot reach those depths. Wait... we can pray. The light can bless your vessel, allowing it to survive the crushing depths of the trench.
- **Guardian**: Do it. We have no other choice.
- **Light Priest**: Very well... everyone, brace yourselves. This will take some time and attract more of the frenzied ones.
#### After:
- **Komodo**: The... the power! My fangs burned with the light! Their defenses were useless against it!
- **Albatross**: My body felt so light, I could soar higher than ever before!
- **Guarduan**: What... just happened?
- **Light Priest**: We... we were arrogant once. We only prayed for ourselves, for our city. But the light... it is pure and selfless. Today we prayed for all, and all were blessed.
- **Light Priest**: The boat is ready. It can take us down to the trench. We will join this fight. We may not have our powers fully restored, but we can still provide some aid.
- **Guardian**: So our journey is close to the end. Thank you, Light Priests. With your help, we will restore peace to our homes.

## Act 3: The Abyssal Trench
### Level 14: (Introduce Abyssal Trench mechanics) The Descent
#### Before:
- **Light Priest**: We descend... The light's blessing holds. Do you feel how the darkness claws at the light? This is an unholy place.
- **Ranger**: Guardian... look at the walls. They're... moving. It's like the trench itself is alive.
- **Luma Tender**: It is alive... It seems to be reacting to the light. We must be careful, or it might crush us.
- **Shell Knight**: Something feels off... Like this place should not exist.
- **Light Priest**: It shouldn't for much longer. The frenzied guardians are here. They are born of this darkness. We must purify them all.
- **Guardian**: This is the heart of the illness. Let's get this over with.
#### After:
- **Ranger**: We're through. That was a tough fight. They're stronger down here.
- **Light Priest**: They are in their native element. But the light still holds.
- **Shell Knight**: Look ahead, Guardian. The trench seems to widen up ahead.
- **Luma Tender**: I can feel it, an immense presence. The... the 'Song' is deafening, the Abyssal Bloom must be close.
- **Light Priest**: We are here. This is the heart of the Trench. Prepare yourselves...

### Level 15: (Final Boss) The Abyssal Bloom
#### Before:
- **Ranger**: That's... it? It looks beautiful. It's not... its not doing anything.
- **Light Priest**: Do not be deceived by its appearance. The Abyssal Bloom is a creature of pure darkness. Its song corrupts everything around it.
- *Some of the singing from the flower*
- **Shell Knight**: We need to destroy it before it consumes our light.
- **Guardian**: Everyone, get ready. This will be our final but toughest fight yet. For Luma Town, for the Holy Land, for all our homes!
#### After:
- **Ranger**: We... we did it! The 'Song' has stopped!
- **Dart Shaman**: The frenzied ones... they are calming down. The darkness is receding.
- **Light Priest**: The Abyssal Bloom is no more. The light has triumphed.
- **Guardian**: We... we have the heart of the Abyssal Bloom. Luma Town is finally safe again.
- **Light Priest**: Your light has saved us all, Guardian. The darkness will not return as long as the light endures. Let us return to your town and celebrate this victory.
- **Guardian**: Yes, let us go home. Together, we have restored peace to our world.
